# byte-map

byte-map is a tool for visualizing and converting between different data formats. It is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Convert

Convert between different data formats: Binary, Hex, and Decimal. Data Type (per IEC 61131-3) and Byte Order (Big Endian or Little Endian) influence the resulting visualization.

## Map

Visualize data as a memory map. In `Encode` mode, each data value requires a value to be specified and the result will be displayed in the data frame. In `Decode` mode, values are specified within the data frame and the result will be displayed in the data values table.

## How do I use it?

Click the website link in the `About` area to use the current published instance, or run it locally via `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`.
